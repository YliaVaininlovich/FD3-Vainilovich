        Once upon a time, book stores were in every town. <br></br>There were the mom and
        pops, and then there were the giants. Each offered a wealth of mystery,
        romance, drama, history, entertainment, education, and a whole lot more.
        <br></br>Then, the internet came along and many of those stores failed and
        folded, leaving people without their favorite haunts to hang out in.
        But, if you ask the right people, theyâ€™ll tell you that the bookstore
        never really went away.<br></br>While mom and pops had a hard time of it and
        several big boxes struggled as well, there are a few bookstores that
        have thrived.
